In order to support the first point of Ass, I created a class(color) that contains 3 int
And even support the third point of the application (singleton) i create in color class function (getInstance) return new color If the color was not in colorStore before
else return Previously Existing
in colorStore class create hashmap to store colors
and a static block Contains default colors These colors are created at the start of the program (5 point)
and i create NewColor class to add new color in hashmap
and showColor class to print default color at the start of App and another function to print Any color you want based on its value
